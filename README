This revision to ks.test() will complement an applied paper
(Emerson and Arnold 2011 to appear in the American Statistician)
and is part of the subject of another paper (in submission
to the R Journal); once we're happy we may propose a change
to R's stats::ks.test.

Please send questions or comments to Jay <john.emerson@yale.edu>
and Taylor <taylor.arnold@yale.edu>
