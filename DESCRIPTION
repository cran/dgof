Description: A revision to the stats::ks.test() function and the associated
        ks.test.Rd help page. With one minor exception, it does not change the
        existing behavior of ks.test(), and it adds features necessary
        for doing one-sample tests with hypothesized discrete
        distributions. The package also contains cvm.test(), for doing
        one-sample Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit tests.
